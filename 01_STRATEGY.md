# 🏆 Paper Submission 2026: Winning Strategy
**Target:** Excellent Paper Award (Automotive Display Section)
**Repository:** [paper_submission_001](https://github.com/heekeunlee/paper_submission_001)

## 1. Failure Analysis (Why did we fail last year?)
Based on the review of the previous submission:
- **Lack of Impact:** Merely reported the fabrication of a 2.1-inch prototype without proving scalability to real automotive sizes (10-15 inches).
- **Weak Comparison:** Only compared narrowly to one BOE paper. Lacked a holistic comparison against modern OLED Dual View or Switchable LC technologies.
- **Inconsistent Data:** Discrepancy between Abstract (1200 nits) and Result (~1000 nits).
- **Missing "Why":** Did not strongly argue *why* Micro-LED is the *ultimate* solution for the "Thermal & Brightness" bottleneck in EVs.

## 2. Key Success Factors (The "Killer Content")
To win this year, we must emphasize:
1.  **"Pain Point" Focus:** Start by attacking the fatal flaws of OLED (Burn-in, luminance drop at high temp) in EV environments.
2.  **Scalability Argument:** Even though the sample is 2.1-inch, provide simulation data or logic regarding transfer yield to prove it works for 12-inch+ Cockpits.
3.  **Reliability Data:** Highlight the **85°C/85%RH** test results. This is the strongest weapon against OLED.
4.  **Zero-Crosstalk:** Emphasize the separation capability (<2%) for safety (Driver distraction).

## 3. Action Plan
- [ ] **Step 1:** Re-structure the outline (Storytelling vs. Reporting).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Gather missing data (Thermal simulation, Scalability logic).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Draft the new content with a focus on "Solution".
- [ ] **Step 4:** Final Review (Sanity check numbers, English polishing).
